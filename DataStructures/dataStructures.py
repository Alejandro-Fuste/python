# Data Structures

# Common data structures for arrays: lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples

# Lists

    # adding to list
        # insert method
        # append method ~ 10:40
        # extend method ~ 10:42

    # removing from list
        # remove method
        # pop method - same as remove, but returns the popped value
        # clear method
        # del keyword

    # length of list
        # count method ~ 10:53
        # len method
        # index method ~ 10:57
        # sort ~ 11:00
        # sort by class ~ 11:27
        # reverse ~ 11:40

    # copy list ~ 11:48
